# Real Coordinate Space ($\mathbb{R}^n$)

Real coordinate spaces are the most fundamental examples of vector spaces. They provide a concrete way to visualize and work with vectors as ordered lists of real numbers.

## Real Numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)
$\mathbb{R}$ (the set of all real numbers) is the simplest vector space. Each real number is a 1-dimensional vector.

## 2D Real Coordinate Space ($\mathbb{R}^2$)
$\mathbb{R}^2$ consists of all ordered pairs $(x,y)$ where $x,y \in \mathbb{R}$. These can be visualized as points in a plane or 2D vectors.

## 3D Real Coordinate Space ($\mathbb{R}^3$)
$\mathbb{R}^3$ consists of all ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ where $x,y,z \in \mathbb{R}$. These can be visualized as points in 3D space.

## n-Dimensional Real Coordinate Space ($\mathbb{R}^n$)
$\mathbb{R}^n$ consists of all ordered n-tuples $(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ where each $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$.

## Verification of Vector Space Properties
Real coordinate spaces satisfy all eight vector space axioms:

1. **Additive Properties**
   - Adding two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ gives another vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$
   - $(x_1,y_1) + (x_2,y_2) = (x_1+x_2, y_1+y_2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$
   - The zero vector $(0,0,...,0)$ exists
   - Each vector has an additive inverse: $-(x,y) = (-x,-y)$

2. **Scalar Multiplication Properties**
   - Multiplying a vector by a real number stays in $\mathbb{R}^n$
   - $c(x,y) = (cx,cy)$ for any scalar $c$
   - All distributive and associative properties hold
