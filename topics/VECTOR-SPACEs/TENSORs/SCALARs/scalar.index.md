# Scalar(s)

> [!NOTE]
>
> A scalar is a single number that solely represents a `magnitude` in a mathematical or scientific context. Unlike vectors, scalars do not possess any directional component; they are purely numerical values.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Scalars are not [VECTOR](./../VECTORs/vector.index.md)s.  
> Scalars are single numbers, while vectors are ordered collections of numbers.  
> - Example: `5mph` is a `speed scalar`, while `5mph North` is a `velocity vector`.

## vs [TENSOR](./tensor.md)

Scalars can be seen as `zero-dimensional arrays` or `order-0 tensors`. They serve as the foundational elements for constructing more complex mathematical objects used in advanced fields such as differential geometry and machine learning.

## vs [VECTOR](./../VECTORs/vector.md)

Scalars are not vectors. Vectors are ordered collections of numbers, while scalars are single numbers.
