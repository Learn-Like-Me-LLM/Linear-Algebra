# Vector Operations

> Vector operations are fundamental algebraic manipulations performed on vectors in a vector space. These operations allow us to combine vectors or scale them, producing either new vectors or scalar values. In linear algebra, vectors can be added or subtracted, scaled by scalar multiplication, combined through linear combinations, and interact with each other via the dot product (yielding a scalar) or cross product (yielding a perpendicular vector). These operations form the basis for more advanced concepts in linear algebra, such as transformations, projections, and systems of linear equations. Understanding vector operations is essential for analyzing geometric properties, physical systems, and abstract vector spaces.
