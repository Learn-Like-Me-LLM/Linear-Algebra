# Linear Combination(s)

A linear combination is formed by:
1. Taking multiple vectors
2. Multiplying each vector by a scalar
3. Adding the resulting vectors together

For example, given vectors $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{w}$, a linear combination would be:
$a\vec{v} + b\vec{w}$ where $a$ and $b$ are scalars

This uses both [scalar multiplication](./scalar-multiplication.md) and [vector addition](../vector-operations.md).
