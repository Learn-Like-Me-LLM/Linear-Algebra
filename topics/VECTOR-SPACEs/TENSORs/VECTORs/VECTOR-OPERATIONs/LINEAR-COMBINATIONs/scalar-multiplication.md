# Scalar Multiplication

> if you multiply a vector by a number you are "stretching" the length of that vector by that number

> if the number you are multiplying the vector by is negative then the vector is flipped 180 degrees before it is stretched

$\begin{bmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} * \frac{1}{3} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix} * 2 = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -6 \end{bmatrix}$

## Dot Product _(Scalar Product)_

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The dot product is a [SCALAR](./scalar.md) quantity that results from the multiplication of two vectors. It is used to determine the:
> - angle between two vectors
> - projection of one vector onto another

> [!EXAMPLE]
> 
> $\langle \vec{a} * \vec{b}  \rangle = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + a_3b_3 +\:... =\sum_{i=1}^3 a_ib_i$

## Inner Product
 
>  a generalization of the dot product. The inner product allows us to define angles between vectors and notions of orthogonality (perpendicularity).
