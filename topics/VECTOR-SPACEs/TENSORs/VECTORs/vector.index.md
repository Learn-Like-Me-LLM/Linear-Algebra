> A mathematical entity that simultaneously possesses both `magnitude` ("length" or "size") and `direction`. It can be visualized as an arrow in geometric space, pointing to a specific location from its `tail`. 

Vectors are fundamental components of [VECTOR SPACES](./vector-spaces/vector-space.md). In practical applications, especially within data science, vectors are crucial for representing multi-dimensional data succinctly. Each component of a vector can correspond to a feature or variable in datasets.

Moreover, while vectors can be abstract entities beyond coordinate systems, such as functions forming vector spaces
under appropriate operations, the core concept remains consistent: **they are ordered, scalable (["operatable"](./operations.md)), and addable quantities
essential across various mathematical and scientific disciplines.**

## vs [TENSOR](./../tensor.md)

Vectors are not tensors. Tensors are higher-dimensional arrays of numbers, while vectors are ordered collections of numbers.

## vs [SCALAR](./../scalar.md)

Vectors are not scalars. Scalars are single numbers, while vectors are ordered collections of numbers.

## vs [MATRIX](./../MATRIXs/matrix.md)

Vectors are not matrices. Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers, while vectors are ordered collections of numbers.

## Representation / Notation

Vectors are represented as `ordered collections of numbers`, where each number corresponds to a `coordinate` in a particular `dimension`. 

[VECTOR NOTATION](./notation.md) is a way to represent vectors using square brackets "[]" as opposed to [POINT NOTATION](./notation.md) that uses smooth brackets "()" to represent individual...points... ðŸ˜‰

## Vector Types

| type                  | description |
| ---                   | --- |
| `zero vector`         | a vector with all components equal to zero |
| `unit vector`         | a vector with a magnitude of 1 |
| `position vector`     | a vector that represents a point in space |
| `free vector`         | a vector that can be moved without changing their effect |
| `bound vector`        | a vector that is anchored at specific points |
| ...etc. | ...etc.     |
