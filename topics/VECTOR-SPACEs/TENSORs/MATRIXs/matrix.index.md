> A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or elements arranged in rows and columns.

## vs [TENSOR](../tensor.md)

Matrices can be seen as `two-dimensional arrays` or `order-2 tensors`. They are widely used in various fields, including linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning.

## vs [VECTOR](../vectors/vector.md)    

Matrices can be seen as `two-dimensional arrays` or `order-2 tensors`. They are widely used in various fields, including linear algebra, statistics, and machine learning.

## vs [SCALAR](../scalar.md)

Matrices are not scalars. Scalars are single numbers, while matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers.
