# Linear Transformations

> - Mappings across entire [Vector Spaces](./vector-spaces/vector-space.md), transforming each vector in the domain to a corresponding vector in the codomain.  
> - [Vector Operations](./vector-operations.md) are integral to the definition and application of linear transformations
