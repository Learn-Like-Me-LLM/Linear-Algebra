# Vector Operations

## Vector Addition / Subtraction

> to add vectors take the tail of the vector2 and put it at the end of vector1. the NEW vector from the origin or vector1 to the end of vector2 is the result of the vector addition.

> [!EXAMPLE]
>
> $V = (1, 2) + W = (3, -1)$
>
$\vec{v} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} + \vec{w}\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \vec{vw}\begin{bmatrix} 1 + 3 \\ 2 + (-1) \end{bmatrix} = \vec{vw}\begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$

## Scalar Multiplication

> if you multiply a vector by a number you are "stretching" the length of that vector by that number

> if the number you are multiplying the vector by is negative then the vector is flipped 180 degrees before it is stretched

$\begin{bmatrix} 9 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} * \frac{1}{3} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$

$\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{bmatrix} * 2 = \begin{bmatrix} 4 \\ -6 \end{bmatrix}$

### Scalar Multiplication


### Dot Product _(Scalar Product)_

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The dot product is a [SCALAR](./scalar.md) quantity that results from the multiplication of two vectors. It is used to determine the:
> - angle between two vectors
> - projection of one vector onto another

## Cross Product _(Vector Product)_

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> The cross product is a [VECTOR](./vector.md) quantity that results from the multiplication of two vectors.
