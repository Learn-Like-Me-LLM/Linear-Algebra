# Vector Quiz

## Question 1
What are the two fundamental properties that define a vector?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

A vector is defined by:
- Magnitude (length/size)
- Direction
</details>

## Question 2
How is a vector different from a scalar quantity?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

While a scalar only has magnitude, a vector has both magnitude and direction. Vectors are ordered, scalable, and addable quantities, while scalars are single numerical values without direction.

## Question 3
What is the difference between vector notation and point notation in mathematical representation?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

- Vector notation uses square brackets [ ]
- Point notation uses smooth brackets ( )
</details>

## Question 4
What is a unit vector and how is it different from a zero vector?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

- Unit vector: A vector with a magnitude of 1
- Zero vector: A vector with all components equal to zero
</details>

## Question 5
Given two vectors:
$\vec{a} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix}$ and 
$\vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$

Calculate $\vec{a} + \vec{b}$

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

$\vec{a} + \vec{b} = \begin{bmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 7 \end{bmatrix}$

We add corresponding components:
- x component: 2 + (-1) = 1
- y component: 3 + 4 = 7
</details>

## Question 6
Given the vector $\vec{v} = \begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix}$, calculate $2\vec{v}$

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

$2\vec{v} = 2\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 6 \\ -4 \end{bmatrix}$

When scaling a vector, multiply each component by the scalar:
- x component: 2 × 3 = 6
- y component: 2 × (-2) = -4
