# Vector Space(s)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> A vector space over a field F is a non-empty set of vectors together with two operations: [vector addition (+)](../operations.md#vector-addition) and [scalar multiplication (·)](../operations.md#scalar-multiplication). These operations must adhere to specific rules, known as [AXIOMS](./axioms.md), to ensure the vector space behaves in a predictable and consistent manner.

They are crucial for organizing and manipulating multi-dimensional datasets and help us understand how vectors interact under [SCALAR](./../scalar.md) [operations](./operations.md). 

Understanding vector spaces equips one with the ability to analyze systems of equations, transformations, and data structures efficiently, making it an essential concept in modern mathematics and its applications.

## Type(s)

### Euclidean Vector Space

> These are the vector spaces we encounter most often, where vectors are represented as n-tuples of real numbers. For example, ℝ² represents the two-dimensional Euclidean plane, and ℝ³ represents three-dimensional space.

### Function Vector Space

> These vector spaces consist of functions as their elements. Examples include the space of continuous functions, the space of differentiable functions, and the space of polynomials.

### Polynomial Vector Space

> These vector spaces consist of polynomials with coefficients from a field.

### Matrix Space _(Vector Space of Matrices)_

These vector spaces consist of matrices of a fixed size with entries from a field.

## Type Enhancements

### Normed Vector Space

> a vector space equipped with a [NORM](./norm.md) (a function that assigns a non-negative length or magnitude to each vector) facilitating distance measurement between vectors and define concepts like convergence.

### Inner Product Space

> a vector space equipped with an [INNER PRODUCT](./inner-product.md), a generalization of the dot product. The inner product allows us to define angles between vectors and notions of orthogonality (perpendicularity).

### Hilbert Space

## Properties

### Subspaces

> A subspace of a vector space is a subset that is itself a vector space under the same operations. For example, within the vector space ℝ³, the set of all vectors lying on a plane passing through the origin forms a subspace.

### Linear Independence

> A set of vectors is linearly independent if no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. For instance, in ℝ³, the vectors (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1) are linearly independent.

### Span

> The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. It represents the subspace generated by the given set of vectors.

### Basis

> A basis for a vector space is a linearly independent set of vectors that spans the entire space. Every vector in the space can be uniquely expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors.

### Dimension

> The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space. It represents the number of independent directions in the space.

### Rank

### Nullity
