| word                  | definition | 
| ---                   | ---                                               | 
| vector                | A mathematical entity that simultaneously possesses both `magnitude` ("length" or "size") and `direction`. It can be visualized as an arrow in geometric space, pointing to a specific location from its `tail` |
| scalar                | a number - often used to modify/"scale" vectors   |
| vector operations     | standard vector operations including addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product maintain the properties required for vector spaces | 
| scalar multiplication | scalar multiplication is unambiguously a linear transformation, while others like addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product are either bilinear or can be considered linear transformations when one argument is fixed |
| scalar product        | *see scalar multiplication | 
| linear transformation |
